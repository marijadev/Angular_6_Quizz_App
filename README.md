# **__Welcome to QuizzApp__**

This application is a **quizz** for taking tests and creating ones. 

It consists of two parts and has two types of users: ***Administrator and User***. 

**Administrator** is an employee with the higher rank who can create questions (for an **Employee** to answer) and answers, who has the authority to validate them and has access to the list of all users and their tests.

**User** is an employee who has a possibility to take the test.

Test consists of three questions added by the **Administrator**. Every question is randomly selected from the database. 

**User** can choose which type of test he wants to take. Tests can be generated by: 

1. Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)

2. Category (JavaScript, Java, PHP) 

3. Combination of Difficulty / Category


## **__Run__**

In your terminal, run `npm install` to install all dependencies. After installing, run `ng serve` for a dev server. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


### **__Administrator__**

To log in as an administrator, when LOGIN page is loaded, type:

*Username*: marko@gmail.com

*Password*: user123

Administrator can see and update his profile, add a new question to the test, validate text questions and has access to all users and their tests.

### **__User__**

*Username*: petar@gmail.com

*Password*: user123

User can select type and/or difficulty of tests he wants to take. 
After the test submit, he can see the list of all passed/failed tests, and validated questions.


# **__Application Structure__**

## **__AUTH__**

At this moment, these users are hard-coded in the database and there is no possibility of registering a new one. 

Therefore, if you want to get access to the application, you need to install the *back-end* from the instructions listed bellow and then login with the credentials provided bellow this text.

**login**: contains login form and logic for user sign-in.

**auth.module.ts**: authentication module

**auth.service.ts**: collecting data form login-page form, and handling login requests from back-end.


## **__CORE__**

**HeaderComponent**: containing header template and routing navigation

**ProfileComponent**: containing user's profile template and **edit-profile component**.

**HomeComponent**: simple template placeholder for quizz components.

**core-routing.module.ts**: basic routes for routing components.

**core.module.ts**: core module with component declarations


## **__ADMIN__**

**Questions-directory**: with the **QuestionComponent** responsible for ***dynamic creation of particular question-component***.

This component is designed for creating a new question.  **Administrator** can add a question, can select difficulty, category and add answer.

There are five types of questions:

**Single Choice**

**Pending-directory**: containing template and logic for text-questions that the administrator needs to validate as __Passed__ or __Failed__.

**Users-directory**: has a **UsersComponent** template with the list of all users and their tests. 

All tests can be filtered by:

1. **Difficulty** (Easy, Medium, Hard)

2. **Category** (JavaScript, Java, PHP) 

3. **Status** (Passed, Failed)
	
All the tests are presented with the dates of their submission. 

Currently the length of tests is 4 per page, in order to show ***custom pagination*** written for this component.

Also, this directory contains **SingleUserComponent** with the information about the selected user and his tests. 

As for the **SingleUserComponent**, all tests are displayed with ***CSS Grid***.
