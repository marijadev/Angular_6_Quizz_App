# **__Welcome to QuizzApp__**

This application is a **quizz** for taking tests and creating ones. 

It consists of two parts and has two types of users: ***Administrator and User***. 

**Administrator** is an employee with the higher rank who can create questions (for an **Employee** to answer) and answers, who has the authority to validate them and has access to the list of all users and their tests.

**User** is an employee who has a possibility to take the test.

Test consists of three questions added by the **Administrator**. Every question is randomly selected from the database. 

**User** can choose which type of test he wants to take. Tests can be generated by: 

1. Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)

2. Category (JavaScript, Java, PHP) 

3. Combination of Difficulty / Category


## **__Run__**

In your terminal, run `npm install` to install all dependencies. After installing, run `ng serve` for a dev server. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


### **__Administrator__**

To log in as an administrator, when LOGIN page is loaded, type:

*Username*: marko@gmail.com

*Password*: user123

Administrator can see and update his profile, add a new question to the test, validate text questions and has access to all users and their tests.

### **__User__**

*Username*: petar@gmail.com

*Password*: user123

User can select type and/or difficulty of tests he wants to take. 
After the test submit, he can see the list of all passed/failed tests, and validated questions.


# **__Application Structure__**

## **__AUTH__**

At this moment, these users are hard-coded in the database and there is no possibility of registering a new one. 

Therefore, if you want to get access to the application, you need to install the *back-end* from the instructions listed bellow and then login with the credentials provided bellow this text.

**login**: contains login form and logic for user sign-in.

**auth.module.ts**: authentication module

**auth.service.ts**: collecting data form login-page form, and handling login requests from back-end.


## **__CORE__**

**HeaderComponent**: containing header template and routing navigation

**ProfileComponent**: containing user's profile template and **edit-profile component**.

**HomeComponent**: simple template placeholder for quizz components.

**core-routing.module.ts**: basic routes for routing components.

**core.module.ts**: core module with component declarations


## **__ADMIN__**

**QUESTIONS-DIRECTORY**: with the **QuestionComponent** responsible for ***dynamic creation of particular question-component***.

This component is designed for creating a new question.  **Administrator** can add a question, can select difficulty, category and add answer.

There are *five types* of questions:

1. **Single Choice Question** - **Administrator** adds a question and a list of several wrong answers and one correct answer for the user. He will check the checkbox on the right side to mark the correct answer. If he tries to submit this question with more than one correct answer, the 'submit button' will be disabled until only one answer is checked as the correct one.

3. **Text Question** - **Administrator** can add the question, yet not the answer. Answer will be provided by the user. **Administrator** will also have the possibility to examine and validate the user's answer to this question-type.

4. **Ordering Question** - **Administrator** adds the question and a list of correct answers. In the inputs on the right side he will add the number to mark the importance of that answer. There cannot be multiple answers with the same value.

5. **Connecting Question** - **Administrator** adds the question and several answer pairs. All the event answers will be mixed later, and the **User** will have to connect the right odd (left side) with the matching even (the right side) of answer.
